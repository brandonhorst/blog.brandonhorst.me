title: "Inventing a new Pokemon Generation with GPT-4 and Midjourney"
---
I like Pokemon. Theoretically, at least. I haven't actually played the games in decades at this point, but I'm still fascinated by these things.

Every few years, a new set of Pokemon games come out. They always introduce around 100 new Pokemon, along with new abilities, items, moves, and mechanics. These are typically called a Generation.

As of August 2023, we're currently on Generation 9, and 1010 pokemon have been created in total.

With the help of GPT-4 and Midjourney, I want to make my own generation! Hopefully this will tickle the part of my brain which still likes Pokemon, while also learning something about generative AI.

### Overview

Simply speaking, we're going to:

- Have GPT-4 generate a few dozen new pokemon, fitting into some of the established tropes of a pokemon generation. It will also generate descriptions of these pokemon that can be passed to Midjourney.
- Use Midjourney to generate images for each pokemon.
- Combine these images into a fun collage to showing off my creation to the internet.

### Creating my Pokemon

For starters, I need to create some Pokemon.

Each new generation has added somewhere between 72 and 151 Pokemon. Since I know part of this process will involve me manually copying images from Midjourney's horrible Discord interface, I'll stick with the lower bound.

Pokemon Generations have certain tropes that they tend to follow. I know a few of these, but this is kind of question that GPT-4 is *really* good at answering. Let's see how it does.

![](../assets/30E49DA7-A773-4A21-8327-11C6F89A0609.jpeg)That's not a bad answer - I'd like my generation to follow many of these tropes.

For each Pokemon, all I need is its name and enough information to pass to Midjourney. This would include its type (which often impacts its color) and a visual description.

To actually generate the list of Pokemon, I'd like to see how things go if I
